Please push all changes to the dev branch

When all changes are pushed to the dev branch and confirmed to be working, initiate a pull request to merge with the main branch

This will ensure there is always an operational main branch

To create new features, or work independently on a feature, we can create branches as needed to ensure we do not work on dev at the same time and create out of synch versions

REMINDER: Push changes often to avoid version conflicts
