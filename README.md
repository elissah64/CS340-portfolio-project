Please push all changes to the dev branch (unless we create branches for each feature)

When all changes are pushed to the dev branch and confirmed to be working, initiate a pull request to merge with the main branch

This will ensure there is always an operational main branch

REMINDER: Push changes often to avoid version conflicts
